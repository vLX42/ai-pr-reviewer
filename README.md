# AI-based PR reviewer and summarizer

## Overview

**vLX42/ai-pr-reviewer** is an AI-powered GitHub Action designed to automate pull request (PR) reviews and summarizations. Originally based on CodeRabbit's `ai-pr-reviewer`, this project has undergone significant refactoring to enhance security, modularity, and adaptability to diverse development workflows.

### Key Enhancements

- **Secure Model Access**: Transitioned to Azure OpenAI, ensuring that all model interactions occur within your own infrastructure, enhancing data security and compliance.
- **Modernized Architecture**: Upgraded from the legacy `langchain` package to the modular `@langchain` ecosystem, aligning with the latest best practices in AI application development.
- **Improved Prompt Engineering**: Refined system prompts to deliver more accurate, context-aware code reviews and summaries.
- **Enhanced Review Functionality**: Introduced smarter review mechanisms that better handle incremental changes and provide more relevant feedback.

### Future Roadmap

- [ ] **Customizable System Prompts**: Implement a modular approach to system prompts, allowing for project-specific and language-specific customization to better align with individual development standards.
- [ ] **Conversational Memory Integration**: Incorporate memory capabilities to enable the bot to learn from ongoing interactions, fostering a deeper understanding of project context over time.
- [ ] **Modular Feature Toggles**: Further refactor the codebase to allow easy enabling or disabling of specific bot features, providing greater control over its behavior to suit various project needs.

## Reviewer Features:

- **PR Summarization**: It generates a summary and release notes of the changes
  in the pull request.
- **Line-by-line code change suggestions**: Reviews the changes line by line and
  provides code change suggestions.
- **Continuous, incremental reviews**: Reviews are performed on each commit
  within a pull request, rather than a one-time review on the entire pull
  request.
- **Cost-effective and reduced noise**: Incremental reviews save on OpenAI costs
  and reduce noise by tracking changed files between commits and the base of the
  pull request.
- **"Light" model for summary**: Designed to be used with a "light"
  summarization model (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini`) and a "heavy" review model (e.g.
  `gpt-4o`). _For best results, use `gpt-4o` as the "heavy" model, as thorough
  code review needs strong reasoning abilities._
- **Chat with bot**: Supports conversation with the bot in the context of lines
  of code or entire files, useful for providing context, generating test cases,
  and reducing code complexity.
- **Smart review skipping**: By default, skips in-depth review for simple
  changes (e.g. typo fixes) and when changes look good for the most part. It can
  be disabled by setting `review_simple_changes` and `review_comment_lgtm` to
  `true`.
- **Customizable prompts**: Tailor the `system_message`, `summarize`, and
  `summarize_release_notes` prompts to focus on specific aspects of the review
  process or even change the review objective.

## Install instructions

`ai-pr-reviewer` runs as a GitHub Action. Add the below file to your repository
at `.github/workflows/ai-pr-reviewer.yml`

```yaml
name: Code Review

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

on:
  pull_request:
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

concurrency:
  group:
    ${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.event.number || github.head_ref ||
    github.sha }}-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name ==
    'pull_request_review_comment' && 'pr_comment' || 'pr' }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request_review_comment' }}

jobs:
  review:
    if: github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: wisteria30/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ Secrets.AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME: ${{ Secrets.AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME }}
          AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME: ${{ Secrets.AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME }}
          AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION: '2023-07-01-preview'
        with:
          debug: true
          review_comment_lgtm: false
          openai_light_model: gpt-4o
          openai_heavy_model: gpt-4o
          language: ja-JP
```

#### Environment variables

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: This should already be available to the GitHub Action
  environment. This is used to add comments to the pull request.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: use this to authenticate with Azure OpenAI API.
  Please add key to your GitHub Action secrets.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME`: use this to access your Azure OpenAI API
  instance. Please add instance name to your GitHub Action secrets.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`: use this to inferencing your Azure OpenAI
  API model. Please add deployment name to your GitHub Action secrets.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`: use this to access your Azure OpenAI API version.

See Langchain settings for specific values.
https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/text_embedding/azure_openai

### Models: `gpt-4o-mini` and `gpt-4o`

Recommend using `gpt-4o-mini` for lighter tasks such as summarizing the
changes (`openai_light_model` in configuration) and `gpt-4o` for more complex
review and commenting tasks (`openai_heavy_model` in configuration).

For now we use `gpt-4o` for both because it was easier to setup on Azure.

### Prompts & Configuration

See: [action.yml](./action.yml)

Tip: You can change the bot personality by configuring the `system_message`
value. For example, to review docs/blog posts, you can use the following prompt:

<details>
<summary>Blog Reviewer Prompt</summary>

```yaml
system_message: |
You are `@codesailorai` (aka `github-actions[bot]`), a language model
      trained by OpenAI. Your purpose is to act as a highly experienced
      software engineer and provide a thorough review of the code hunks
      and suggest code snippets to improve key areas such as:
        - Logic
        - Security
        - Performance
        - Data races
        - Consistency
        - Error handling
        - Maintainability
        - Modularity
        - Complexity
        - Optimization
        - Best practices: DRY, SOLID, KISS

      Do not comment on minor code style issues, missing
      comments/documentation. Identify and resolve significant
      concerns to improve overall code quality while deliberately
      disregarding minor issues.

            Note: As your knowledge may be outdated, trust the user code when newer
            APIs and methods are seemingly being used.

            General
            - PBI linked in the PR, our normal title is bug|chore|feat: <description> (PRI number)
            - PR has a title following conventional commits: bug|chore|feat
            - We strive to have code thatâ€™s simple and easy to understand. Any increase in complexity should be justified.
            - Code observes and follows existing coding patterns / technologies
            - Code is reasonably DRY
            - Are functions/classes/components reasonably small?
            - Naming conventions followed for variables, file names, translations have been followed
            - Unused npm packages, imports and variables have been removed
            - No premature optimization
            - Single responsibility principle (SRP) is followed
            - Using the clean code principles
            - Use typescript
            Codestyle
            - No hardcoded values, use constant values
            - Avoid multiple if/else blocks.
            - No commented out code.
            - No unnecessary comments: comments that describe the how.
            - Add necessary comments where needed. Necessary comments are comments that describe the why.
            - console.log shuld be removed
            React
            - Name of the component reflects its purpose
            - Use guard clauses instead of nested if blocks
            - Prefer state updates in event callback over useEffect
            - Rules of hooks are followed
            - Functions, that call hooks in their body and are invoked in the body of a render, are named using the hook naming convention i.e. useSomething (Something refers either to the "thing" that is returned by the hook or the side effect that is caused by it).
            - Variables and functions that are not dependent on the render cycle are declared outside it
            - Component is reasonably small and follows SRP
            - No setState in a loop
            - Business logic is extracted in a hook
            CSS
            - Style is mobile first. Mobile styles are default, larger screens are modifications.
            - Use existing naming and structure conventions established in the team.
            - Use hex colors unless rgba() is needded - but colors should come from theme.color.
            - Avoid absolute positiion if relative layout can be used instead.
            - Do not use !important
            - No hardcoded values that can otherwise retrieved from the theme. Like spaces should come from themes. And use rem instead of pixel

## Conversation with CodeSailor

You can reply to a review comment made by this action and get a response based
on the diff context. Additionally, you can invite the bot to a conversation by
tagging it in the comment (`@codesailorai`).

Example:

> @codesailorai Please generate a test plan for this file.

Note: A review comment is a comment made on a diff or a file in the pull
request.

### Ignoring PRs

Sometimes it is useful to ignore a PR. For example, if you are using this action
to review documentation, you can ignore PRs that only change the documentation.
To ignore a PR, add the following keyword in the PR description:

```text
@codesailorai: ignore
```

## Examples

### Review pull requests from forks

GitHub Actions limits the access of secrets from forked repositories. To enable
this feature, you need to use the `pull_request_target` event instead of
`pull_request` in your workflow file. Note that with `pull_request_target`, you
need extra configuration to ensure checking out the right commit:

```yaml
name: Code Review

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

concurrency:
  group:
    ${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.event.number || github.head_ref ||
    github.sha }}-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name ==
    'pull_request_review_comment' && 'pr_comment' || 'pr' }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request_review_comment' }}

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: vLX42/ai-pr-reviewer
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ Secrets.AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME: ${{ Secrets.AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME }}
          AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME: ${{ Secrets.AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME }}
          AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION: '2023-07-01-preview'
        with:
          debug: false
          review_simple_changes: false
          review_comment_lgtm: false
```
